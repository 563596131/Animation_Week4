# Animation
 Week4 Demo

I created two layers of scenes and made animations for them respectively. In the first layer, the character will pick up gold coins along the way and display them in the UI in the lower right corner, and finally reach the door to trigger the door opening animation and scene transition. An NPC is added in the second scene (although it is the same model as the player), when the player passes by the NPC, they will have a conversation with the NPC and then proceed to the door, the scene finally switches back to the Mainmenu
